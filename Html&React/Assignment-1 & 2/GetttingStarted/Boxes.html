                <p>Java is a powerful, object-oriented programming language widely used for building platform-independent applications. Known for its “Write Once, Run Anywhere” capability, Java runs smoothly across different operating systems using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It is commonly used in enterprise systems, Android development, backend services, banking applications, and high-performance distributed systems. With strong memory management, multi-threading, and a huge ecosystem of libraries and frameworks like Spring Boot and Hibernate, Java remains a top choice for scalable and secure application development.</p>

                <p>.NET is a versatile and robust development framework 
                    created by Microsoft for building web, desktop, 
                    cloud, and enterprise applications. With support
                     for multiple languages like C#, F#, and VB.NET, 
                     it provides developers with flexibility 
                     and performance. Modern .NET (.NET Core and .NET 6/7/8) allows cross-platform development, enabling applications to run on Windows, Linux, and macOS. It includes powerful frameworks like ASP.NET for web development, Entity Framework for data access, and strong security features, making it ideal for corporate applications, microservices, and cloud-based solutions on Azure.</p>
