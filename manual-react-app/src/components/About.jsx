      <p>
        Hi, I’m Aathityan Mariraj. I’m a passionate web developer with a
        strong interest in modern technologies like React and Redux. I love
        building interactive web applications that are both user-friendly and
        efficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy solving problems, writing clean code, and continuously learning
        new tools and frameworks to improve my skills. I’m always curious and
        eager to take on new challenges in the fast-paced world of web
        development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of coding, I value creativity, growth, and collaboration. My
        goal is to create projects that not only work well but also provide a
        great experience for the users.
      </p>
